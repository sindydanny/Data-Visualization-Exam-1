# Data-Visualization-Exam-1

The company is currently reliant on manual processes using Excel for data analysis and decision-making. 
However, they are aware of the limitations of this approach and are seeking to transition to dynamic data visualization tools that can provide more efficient and insightful solutions. 
This project is to create actual data visualizations, including dashboards and reports, using dynamic data visualization tools. These visualizations will replace the manual Excel-based processes and will provide actionable insights to support decision-making. These insights will be highlighted as key points in the presentation to demonstrate the value of dynamic data visualization tools.
